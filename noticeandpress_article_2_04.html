                <p>Efforts to improve legislation and systems for the protection of animals to prevent the detection and cruelty of animals in the unlicensed animal production industry The introduction of an autonomous labeling system for the cost of pet care</p>
                <p>According to a 2020 survey by the Korea Institute of Rural Economics,<br>The pet rearing population of our country is<br>About 1.5 million people of domestic households<br>About 1/4 of them are with pets.</p>
                <p>In the lives of people like this,<br>Although the proportion of pets has increased significantly,<br>Awareness of animal rights remains inadequate.</p>
                <p>Animal Protection Group Life<br>A society in which humans and animals can coexist<br>Strive to make.<br>Responding to the rampant animal cruelty in society<br>Supporting the revision of animal protection laws, etc.<br>Life does a lot to protect animal rights.</p>
                <p>Still in the blind spot of the law<br>There are many animals that suffer unnecessarily and are abused.<br>Changes in Social Perceptions and Statutes<br>Maintenance is at a point where everything is needed.</p>
                <p>Sim In-sup, Representative of the animal protection organization Life,<br>When an animal is recognized for its dignity as a living being<br>I believe that our society will be healthier.</p>
                <p>Q. There have been a number of animal cruelty cases in recent years,<br>The so-called dog factory, called the cat factory<br>Excessive animal production is at the centre.<br>The cat factory incident in Gimhae last year,<br>Cases such as the Permanent Cat Factory Incident<br>It's a pity,<br>Animal production industry in the field<br>Please tell us about reality.</p>
                <p>The animal production industry is protected by the Animal Protection Act.<br>It is a form of business using animals as stipulated.<br>It was originally a report.<br>After the so-called 'puppy factory' incident in 2016<br>To rectify the angry public sentiment<br>The government changed it to a licensing system.</p>
                <p>But this permission is also<br>Realistically Abuse Animals<br>It is the problem that it is playing a role in encouraging,<br>A prime example is 1 person<br>You can manage up to 75 animals,</p>
                <p>75 Dogs Alone<br>You can't take care of it healthily.<br>Absolutely impossible.<br>The system itself is responsible for animal cruelty<br>It is to make it entailed.<br>What would you say it's a real scene?</p>\
                <p>Also, if you violate the licensing system,<br>The fine is less than 5 million won.<br>Who is properly licensed to do business?<br>(In September 2020, Congressman Choi In-ho's office announced that<br>To an Unauthorized Animal Producer with Life<br>imprisonment of not more than a year, a fine of not more than 10 million won<br>How to Increase Punishment<br>Revised and proposed.)</p>

                <p>Q. Animal Protection Group Life<br>For the protection of animals<br>There are a lot of activities.<br>In the business of life and the vision it pursues<br>Tell us about it.</p>
                <p>For the happy coexistence of animals and people<br>We are working on a number of projects.</p>
                <p>Animal Relief or Legislation and<br>Activities to improve the system,<br>For Citizens and Young Youth<br>Animal protection education or adoption center, etc.<br>Animals are essentially members of this earth.<br>As a creature with a perception of pain<br>Dignity must be recognized<br>Have values and<br>To this end, for the benefit of human beings<br>Animals that are indiscriminately victimized<br>Efforts are being made to reduce it.</p>
                <p>Q. In the activities and operations of animal protection organizations<br>If you find it difficult or need more help<br>What do you think?</p>
                <p>Having the character of a civic movement<br>I think it's the same for any group, but<br>In particular, animal protection groups are directly rescued.<br>Because there are animals<br>the cost of treatment for these animals and<br>The cost of care<br>It is different from other NGOs,</p>
                <p>It's well above the usual current expenses.<br>So, naturally, there is an absolute lack of operating costs.<br>Also not enough space<br>Situations in which animals can no longer be rescued<br>As it happens, there are also spatial problems.<br>This is the part that will be solved.</p>
                <p>Q. I am working to protect animal rights<br>Sorry for me for a while or<br>Did you have anything left on the stag?</p>
                <p>Rescued, but the timing of treatment<br>You have already missed it and died in the hospital, or<br>You need to rescue right away, but you have the right space or<br>Can't find a way to do anything<br>Feeling helpless, or<br>It hurts a lot emotionally.</p>
                <p>Closing the Gupo Dog Market on the Verge of Closure<br>Failed to save more dogs<br>Self-aggrandizement of real problems<br>Especially it remains on the chest.</p>
                <p>Q. What have I felt a great sense of accomplishment during my activities,<br>What was rewarding?</p>
                <p>Rather than succeeding in a structure that is difficult for others to accomplish.<br>When a rescued animal meets a lifelong family<br>It's the most rewarding.</p>
                <p>Although the structure can be done by anyone<br>Creating a Family means<br>Because no one else can.</p>
                <p>The animals that were being protected<br>After meeting family members<br>Seeing that we have forgotten in black is<br>It is a falsification of finding a better environment than we are.<br>Surely we have fulfilled our mission.<br>It's rewarding.</p>

                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
