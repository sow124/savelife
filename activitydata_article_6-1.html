                <p>(a) Homogeneity protection group Life<br>Animal Protection Organizations<br>Humane Society International Korea<br>(Humane Society International/Korea)<br>(hereinafter HSI)<br>Operated for edible purposes for the past 20 years<br>We caught a catamaran edible dog farm.</p>
                <p>The farm is home to 60 farmers.<br>For edible purposes for the past 20 years or so<br>By purchasing dogs of the Jindo Mix breed and<br>He was slaughtered while breeding,<br>The slaughtered dog is the farmer himself.<br>Jindo County, which was operated by itself, in the high-face material<br>From the Bosintang House to the Bosintang<br>It turns out that it has been sold.</p>
                <p>When the screams of the dogs on the farm ceased,<br>By reports of unbearable neighbors<br>In early July, he was caught by police as a current offender.<br>Currently accused of violating the Animal Protection Act<br>Investigation by the Prosecutor (Mokpo Bureau)<br>I was receiving.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_6_01_02.jpg" alt="개농장에 갇힌 진돗개들">
                <p>The Jindo Army has a national budget<br>The Jin Dogs under the management of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and the Jindo Army<br>A total of 10,000.</p>
                <p>Of these, 4 thousand are<br>It has been designated as Natural Monument No. 53,<br>The remaining 6,000 are natural monuments<br>It is protected by a reserve resource.</p>
                <p>In this group of progress, the dogs of the Jindo species<br>Not only were they raised and slaughtered for edible purposes.<br>The fact that it even includes a natural monument candidate dog<br>I was horrified.</p>
                <p>In addition, the Jindo Army is a case where the farmer in question is<br>In front of the sight of a homogeneous animal<br>Through the act of killing animals<br>Violation of the Animal Protection Act (School of Zoology) as a current offender<br>He was aware of his presence in the police,</p>
                <p>Accordingly, from animal abusers<br>Despite the need to isolate the animal,<br>Lack of animal protection space and<br>Animal cruelty can be diagnosed<br>For reasons such as the absence of a veterinarian<br>Not a single dog is placed in emergency quarantine<br>We weren't there.</p>
                <p>On the ongoing protests of Life and HSI<br>The Jindo Army was about a month after the incident occurred.<br>I accompanied the farm to the veterinarian,<br>About the catamarans left behind in the dog farm where the slaughter has stopped<br>Signs of physical and emotional abuse with the naked eye<br>We concluded that it was impossible to find.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_6_01_03.jpg" alt="개농장">
                <p>Life and HSI with Dog Farmers<br>Through individual negotiations<br>Ownership of the remaining dogs was transferred,<br>Only then will the rescue of the animals be carried out.<br>We were able to proceed.</p>
                <p>On the day of the rescue, the groups<br>Contrary to the words of the planters,<br>Under the management of the Ministry of Cultural Properties and the Jindo Army<br>Tentacles have also been found.</p>
                <p>The catamarans that are managed through the state's budget<br>All have built-in recognition chips planted in them.<br>Organizations use scanners (readers)<br>The unique number of the corresponding objects has been checked,<br>We plan to go through a legal review and make additional accusations, etc.</p>
                <p>On one side, it boasts that it is a natural monument of the country,<br>On the other side, you can put it on the table and enjoy it.<br>It was a scene of anger beyond horror.</p>
                <p>Human duality, of course,<br>There are also problems with the system and the national level.<br>It's a scene to show.</p>
                <p>A catamaran designated as a natural monument and<br>The difference between a catamaran sacrificed for food<br>We don't know.<br>Whether the catamaran is a natural monument or not,<br>Everyone has communication with people<br>It should be borne in mind that it is an almost perfect pet.</p>

                <p>In one of the slaughterhouses of the dog farm,<br>When dogs that have been brutally slaughtered are alive<br>The leash I was doing was stacked in a heap.</p>
                <p>This means that the dogs that were slaughtered at the dog farm<br>Not that they have been breeding, but<br>Was being raised by someone<br>It's proof that they're dogs.</p>
                <p>The fact that there is a separate dog and an edible dog<br>It is also a disproof that it is not.<br>The ban on eating in our generation is<br>It must be finished.</p>
                <p>All the dogs rescued today<br>Moving to a foster shelter prepared by animal protection groups East Sea<br>It will be managed and protected.<br>If there is no domestic adoption thereafter,<br>Go to the United States and Canada, etc.<br>We will be proceeding with the adoption.</p>
                <p>In addition, through continuous communication with the Jindo County Council,<br>For edible purposes<br>strongly regulates the practice of raising dogs,<br>Isolate abused and organic animals;<br>Improving the Safeguarding Scheme<br>Let me urge you.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
