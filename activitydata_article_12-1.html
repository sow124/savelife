                <h4>Busan City Turning Away from Emergency Care Animals (Application for Adoption of Puppy with Grandma Dementia in her 80s)</h4>
                <span>Registration Date <time datetime="2020-10-19T06:53:02TZD"> 2020-10-19 06:53:02 PM</time> Author Life</span>
                <span>Attachment <a href="images/activitydata_12_01.jpg">activitydata_12_01</a></span>
                <p>Last week, I received a phone call.</p>
                <p>My grandmother, a basic living security recipient in her<br>80s who lives alone in Busan, is uncomfortable with mobility and has severe<br>hearing loss, and she recently came to dementia and had to be transferred to a<br>nursing hospital, but<br>the puppy her grandson brought with her was struck in<br>the eye and refused to be admitted.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_12_01_01.png" alt="80대 치매 할머니와 함께 지내던 강아지 ">
                <p>Even her grandson, who was the only family member of her grandmother, died<br>in<br>a car accident last month and had no one to take care of the puppy,<br>and she was holding out saying she couldn't<br>go to a nursing home until she had a place to take care of the pampered puppy</p>
                <p>When the animal protection group Life received the news&lt;contacted the Pet Welfare and Culture Center operating in Busan City to<br>use the Emergency Protected Animal System&gt;, but the answer was that it was not possible.</p>
                <p>The &lt;Emergency Protected Animal System&gt; is a system set out in the Ordinance on the Protection and Welfare of Animals in Busan City, which was amended in January last year,<br>in which animals in<br>need of urgent protective measures are acquired and protected or<br>distributed by the<br>City of Busan.</p>
                <p>It is defined here that an emergency protected animal is an animal that is<br>difficult to receive adequate protection for reasons<br>such as the death of its owner.<br>Grandmother puppies are also emergency care animals.</p>
                <p>However, due to this or that excuse of the Busan Municipal Affairs Department,<br>the protection measures were finally rejected.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_12_01_02.png" alt="케이지안에 있는 강아지 ">
                <p>The animal protection group Life first visited the site in person to check the animal's<br>situation,<br>Deciding that the situation was not possible to be cared for by the grandmother, the animal was rescued and taken to the<br>hospital.</p>
                <p>Through the consultation at the veterinary clinic, I noticed that my teeth were<br>in poor condition<br>and decided to combine the foot with neutering surgery.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_12_01_03.png" alt="병원에서 치료받는 강아지 ">
                <p>Through<br>the request for temporary care of animals, many people have extended a helping hand and<br>have sought appropriate temporary shelter.</p>
                <p>However, during the period of temporary protection<br>You need to find a family that will take charge of your whole life<br>The homework is still there.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_12_01_04.png" alt="치료다 받고 쉬고있는 강아지 ">
                <p>In the case of the rescue of animals that have been denied emergency protection by the<br>city of<br>Busan, as in this case,<br>This year alone, it's already three times.</p>
                <p>Two dogs that were left unattended by a mentally ill person in a house in<br>Donglae District last March,</p>
                <p>A cat whose owner collapsed from a stroke in a swimming pool last May and was left alone on<br>the rooftop,</p>
                <p>And, this time Grandma's puppy.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_12_01_05.png" alt="케이지안에 있는 강아지 ">
                <p>Whenever you request emergency protection<br>The city of Busan struck a hand every time saying that there was a situation,<br>and each time it was taken over by the animal protection organization Life.</p>
                <p>Animal Protection Group Life Every Time<br>Animals cannot be rescued and protected.</p>
                <p>Space required for the structure and the cost of treatment, etc.<br>Not sponsored by the government and municipalities<br>It's too hard for a nonprofit to handle.</p>
                <p>Aging, an increase in 1-person households,<br>and an increasing pet population are unavoidable social phenomena.</p>
                <p>Therefore, these urgent animal protection cases are<br>bound to continue to occur in the future.</p>
                <p>In a world where even the existing systems are<br>not in place, can we really create a happy city<br>and a happy country with pets?</p>
                <p>Busan City on September 8th,<br>Busan Municipal Veterinarian Association, together with the Busan Daily<br>For the establishment of pet culture and the cultivation of industry<br>We have signed an MOU.</p>
                <p>In this position, Busan City,<br>For the realization of happy Busan with pets<br>To develop various policies and improve related systems.<br>He has stated that he will take the lead.</p>
                <p>Such a slogan in Busan City It only feels empty.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_12_01_06.png" alt="누워있는강아지 ">
                <p>Animal Protection Group Life<br>In order to prevent this problem from<br>being repeated, we have asked the Busan City Council to improve the relevant system.<br>The Busan City Council has pledged active cooperation.</p>
                <p>Life also solves the problem<br>I promise to work to the end.</p>
                <p>Busan City's complacent attitude<br>It puts the animal in crisis at bay.</p>
                <p>The Animal Protection Act sets out the responsibilities of states and municipalities for<br>the proper protection and management of animals.</p>
                <p>The reasons for the enactment of the Animal Protection Act in Busan City and<br>We should not forget the intention.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
