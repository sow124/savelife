                <p>◇ Hello everyone, Lee Eun-jung> is a producer.<br>The domestic pet population has already exceeded ten million people.<br>About one in five people have a pet.<br>If you look at the statistics for 2019, only pets registered in Busan Province<br>That's 106,000 animals.<br>It's the second largest number after Gyeonggi, Seoul.</p>
                <p>But as the population that raises pets grows,<br>The Pet Desertion or Abused Bite Accident,<br>Conflicts between companions and non-companions,<br>There are also a number of social problems that are emerging.</p>
                <p>Monitor animal problems and where help is needed<br>It is located in Busan where the animal is directly rescued.<br>It's an animal rights organization.<br>This year marks the 1st anniversary of its establishment.<br>Let's talk with Representative Sim In-sup.<br>Hello President.</p>
                <p>◆ Sim In-sup> Yes, hello.</p>
                <p>◇ Lee Eun-jung > Launched Animal Protection Group Life<br>I was told it was 1 year.<br>How did it come to be built in the first place?</p>
                <p>◆ Sim In-sup> I was doing well<br>Leaving an animal protection organization,<br>What I want to do?<br>I want to do animal protection activities properly<br>I thought about it and made it in Busan.</p>
                <p>◇ Lee Eun-jung > under the umbrella of Busan City<br>There was a pet welfare and cultural center.<br>Is it different from this?</p>
                <p>◆ Sim In-sup > completely separate.<br>Busan City Pet Welfare Cultural Center<br>I was in Busan City Resident Participation Budget System around 2016<br>Let's introduce this adoption center concept business.<br>Proposed in Busan City,<br>It's a place that is now managed directly by the city.<br>Our animal rights organization Life<br>You can look at it as a general civic organization.</p>
                <p>◇ Lee Eun-jung> Such an animal protection center<br>How many are there in Busan?</p>
                <p>◆ Sim In-sup > now there are 16 districts and counties.<br>A shelter that is entrusted by the district and county<br>5 places in Busan, it's a consignment concept.</p>
                <p>◇ Lee Eun-jung > compared to Seoul and Gyeonggi-do<br>Isn't that a little bit of a small number?</p>
                <p>◆ Sim In-sup> In fact, the old and military<br> Running a shelter that operates directly<br> It seems like the best fit, but<br> In the form of a foster shelter under various conditions,<br> It's operating.</p>
                <p>Due to the nature of the foster care center<br>Many problems, more or less,<br>The problem that is always at the root is<br>It looks like you can have it.</p>
                <p>◇ Lee Eun-jung > Yes Then<br>In the animal protection organization Life<br>What activities are you doing that are primarily animal-related?</p>
                <p>◆ Sim In-sup > People and Animals<br>I want to create a world that co-exists.<br>You can see it as a mission.</p>
                <p>Directly relieve abused animals and<br>Although it also serves to protect and send adoption,<br>Fundamentally improve the system,<br>Through life-respecting education<br>How to realize some of the values of animal protection<br>For this part, too,<br>We're pouring out our capabilities.</p>
                <p>◇ In the case of Lee Eun-jung > Busan<br>The pet population has grown tremendously,<br>Hasn't the organic animal grown a little bit as well?<br>What about?</p>
                <p>◆ Sim In-sup > increasing.<br>The animal itself started at about five thousand or two,<br>Now it's almost something from seven thousand to close to eight thousand or two<br>I know it's going to be.<br>Over time, organic animals do the same.<br>It is showing an increasing trend.</p>
                <p>◇ Lee Eun-jung > Animal Protection Group Life<br>Establish your own,<br>It's now our 1st anniversary.<br>How do you look back on the past 1 year?<br>There seems to have been a lot going on.</p>
                <p>◆ Sim In-sup > quite at stake.<br>It's the fate of animal protection groups, unlike ordinary NGOs.<br>Animals rescued and rescued<br>From treatment, care, and adoption to<br>There is a lot of capital and manpower involved.<br>The past year has been quite<br>It seems that you have walked a precarious path.</p>
                <p>◇ Lee Eun-jung > not only Busan<br>He also works all over the country...<br>Do you have anything left in your memory?</p>
                <p>◆ Established a group at the beginning of the Sim In-sup ><br>Soon afterward, I discovered the Busan Water Permanent Cat Factory.<br>I rescued the cats.<br>And in just 3 months,<br>Kim Hashi at the cat factory in Daedong-myeon<br>Rescued 30 cats.</p>
                <p>Even with that alone, honestly,<br>The group is in debt,<br>In October last year, Gyeonggi-do Gimpo<br>I went to shoot another broadcast,<br>After the discovery of an illegal farm<br>I was quite troubled.</p>
                <p>In a difficult situation, the Life Group<br>To rescue and care for these animals safely<br>Can I play such a role?<br>I was thinking a lot,<br>It was incredibly conflicting.<br>The memory remains.<br>The memory of that time seems to take away for the rest of my life.</p>
                <p>◇ Because there are difficulties in the operation of Lee Eun-jung ><br>In situations where animals need to be rescued<br>I think it might be a bit of a hesitation.</p>
                <p>◆ Sim In-sup > a matter of course.<br>In a state of wholeness<br>There are very few kids who are rescued.</p>
                <p>Animals are always abused<br>You have been physically harmed or<br>Naturally, such friends are in the hospital<br>You need to get some intensive care.</p>
                <p>Basic one month, two months of hospitalization<br>Because it is a situation that needs to be treated.<br>I have no choice but to get hospital treatment.</p>
                <p>Because we now have a traditional cat factory<br>In a situation where the hospital expenses that cannot be repaid are tens of millions of won<br>Gimpo was really going wrong for us<br>I thought the organization might go bankrupt.<br>So I thought about it a lot.<br>Organizations need to grow sustainably.<br>Doing things that go far beyond the collective capacity<br>We wonder if the organization can do it.</p>
                <p>◇ Relieve and protect Lee Eun-jung >,<br>Because it's a step up to adoption.<br>How do you pay for the operation?<br>I'm worried that I'm in debt now.</p>
                <p>◆ Sim In-sup> debt is something that is in debt.<br>Almost 100% of the regular patrons<br>It's becoming a sponsorship dues.<br>Depending on the issue, temporarily<br>In some cases, you've sponsored it.<br>The most basic part is<br>It is sponsored by regular sponsors.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
