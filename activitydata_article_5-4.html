                <p>&lt; Jindo County Natural Monument No. 53<br>Progress Dog Edible Dog Farm Detection Incident&gt;</p>
                <p>Note: Natural monuments in Jindo County<br>The dog designated as No. 53 is a progress dog, and the dog that is not is a progress dog.<br>It is called a catamaran.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_5_04_01.jpg" alt="개농장사진">
                <p>Life in Jindo County, Chunnam last July,<br>We have received a report that an edible catamaran farm is in<br>operation.</p>
                <p>I was horrified that this was happening at<br>a magnitude called the breakdown of the<br>progress dog.</p>
                <p>Visit the site in person<br>According to the bar to confirm,<br>the camp has a gin dog farm<br>Fail the Natural Monument Examination or<br>Unexamined Dogs,<br>And within the Jindo Army<br>Raised as someone's dog<br>They were buying and breeding catamarans.</p>
                <p>He had even been selling<br>it on the spot at the Bosintang house<br>where he was operating.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_5_04_02.jpg" alt="개농장에있는 목줄들">
                <p>However, even<br>as this was known, due to the non-cooperation of the Jindo Army,<br>no emergency isolation of the<br>remaining animals was carried out.</p>
                <p>After all, life is<br>Over 700 kilometers round trip is traveled<br>every week, persuading farmers to pay for and<br>get their dogs<br>I had no choice but to buy.</p>
                <p>A total of 65 dogs<br>were then rescued from their deaths on the day<br>of the horse on August 10.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_5_04_03.jpg" alt="개농장에갇혀있는 개">
                <p>However, in the course of a full-fledged rescue, a<br>more surprising truth was revealed.</p>
                <p>On the day of the rescue, the result of confirming the internal chip through<br>the electronic chip reader</p>
                <p>1 Natural Monument No. 53 Progress Dog, which must be strictly controlled by the Ministry of<br>Cultural Properties and the Jindo County,<br>and<br>1 Natural Monument Examination Preliminary Dog were<br>found.</p>
                <p>In response to this issue, the Jindo Army said<br>that the edible of the Jindo dog is nothing more than a malicious rumor, and the<br>natural monuments found are<br>He explained that it was raised for the purpose<br>of the farmer.</p>
                <p>On the elucidation of the outrageous Jindo Army<br>I<br>was just laughing at it.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_5_04_04.jpg" alt="개농장에갇혀있는 개2">
                <p>Life is the National Assembly Choi In-ho,<br>Private Flag, Through Congressman Park Jae-ho's Office<br>We obtained various materials<br>related to the Natural Monument Progress Dog to find<br>out the problems with the Natural Monument Progress Dog Policy and the Korea Progress Dog Protection and Cultivation Act, and continued to consult with<br>the Congressional Office to improve the<br>system.</p>
                <p>At the October 5 National Assembly State Affairs Audit<br>Choi In-ho, a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Dedicated Flag,<br>respectively, asked the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, Livestock and Food and the Director of the Ministry of Cultural Properties, respectively, to discuss<br>the Jindo County's Jindo Dog Edible Farm.<br>We will inquire about the problems and the like, and<br>ask for the improvement measures of the administration.</p>
                <p>Life goes to and from the National Assembly, etc.<br>As I was in the activity,<br>I received unexpected news.</p>
                <p>Rescued from Jindo County Dog Farm<br>Dogs that are being protected are<br>a little purified.<br>During the re-inspection of the electronic chips,<br>there were 9 additional animals in all.<br>It was confirmed that the electronic chip was built-in,<br>A whopping 3 of them have been identified as registered as<br>natural monuments.</p>
                <img src="images/activitydata_article_5_04_05.jpg" alt="칩이있나 검사중">
                <p>Thus, of the 65 animals rescued from the progress,<br>Of the 58 except for 7 young dogs<br>In 11 electron chips were found,<br>4 of which were converted into natural monuments.<br>A registered object.</p>
                <p>The remaining 7 are<br>It can be dropped from the natural monument review or<br>presumed to be an unexamined entity.</p>
                <p>but<br>All 7 of these fathers and dogs<br>It is a registered object of a natural monument.<br>That's why the electronic chip is built-in.</p>
                <p>In the face of this tremendous result,<br>We couldn't hide our surprise.</p>
                <p>The farmer raised it as a dog<br>A Natural Monument<br>Wasn't it accidentally discovered in an edible dog farm and was the elucidation of the Jindo Army in the<br>meantime?</p>
                <p>Then I found an additional<br>What purpose did the 3 Natural Monument Progress Dogs<br>have been raised by the dog farmer?</p>
                <p>If the structure of life had been late,<br>What<br>kind of end did those Natural Monument dogs have?</p>

                <p>Only Natural Monument Progress Dog<br>It wasn't a problem.</p>
                <p>Through this incident, the Natural Monument System<br>Only the boats of some of the breeding farmers are called and<br>recognized as non-natural monuments.<br>Many natural monument drop-out<br>dogs that have been treated as bad dogs have been around for the<br>past 50 years or more,<br>It has been sacrificed in the Jindo Army as<br>a material of the Bosintang.<br>I could estimate.</p>
                <p>It's too late, but<br>I hope that the executive and<br>legislative branches will now be held accountable on this issue, and<br>I promise that Life will continue its end-to-end<br>efforts to improve the system.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
