                <h4>Here are some of the cats that have been rescued from the Busan Permanent Illegal Cat Farm.</h4>
                <span>Registration Date <time datetime="2020-06-25T10:57:56TZD">2020-06-25 10:57:56 AM</time> Author Life</span>
                <span>Attachment <a href="images/activitydata_14_03.jpg">activitydata_14_03</a></span>
                <p>Life took over ownership of the 10 cats that were rescued from the Permanent Cat Factory.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, 2 of them had to cross the rainbow bridge during treatment.</p>
                <p>Life transported all the remaining 8 cats to a cooperative hospital for ongoing veterinary treatment.</p>
                <p>After being transported to the hospital, a check-up showed that all cats were severely underweight, with nutritional imbalances, herpesis,<br>Severe diseases such as calicivirus, ear mite, and pneumonia appeared.</p>
                <p>The medical staff worked hard, but due to the cats' nutritional status, they lacked a lot of basic stamina, so their recovery was quite slow.</p>
                <p>However, Life and the medical staff did their best to take care of the cats.</p>
                <p>We introduce you to the 8 guys who came into Life's arms through photos from the time of the rescue.</p>
                <p>(The name had been arbitrarily named by the hospital.)</p>
                <p>1. Sia (estimated to be a long-seedling Siamese family) / 3 months old / 490 g / girls / conjunctivitis, ear mite, herpetitis , fungal dermatitis</p>
                <p>- At the time of the rescue, Sia was deeply concerned about the damage to the conjunctiva that caused one eye to be completely covered with inflammation.</p>
                <p>2. Perry (Persian series) / 3 months old / 310 g / South / conjunctivitis, calicivirus, tongue ulcer, ear mite</p>
                <p> - Perry had been in a state of distraction at the time of the rescue due to his severe underweight and the resulting loss of energy.</p>
                <p>3. Dongle (Scottish Fold) / 6 months old / 1.6 kg / male / nasal mucosa bleeding, suspected feline leukemia, fungal dermatitis</p>
                <p>- The dongle is very affectionate to the person, and the face is also cute with the dongle dongle.</p>
                <p>4. Curl (American curl) / 3 years old / 2.3 kg / girl / need to check for neurological symptoms</p>
                <p>- Attractive curls with amber eyes on a black face tend to have their heads bowed in one direction, requiring a more detailed examination.</p>
                <p>5. Cheese (Scottish Fold) / 3 years old / 2.9 kg / Boy / Herpetith virus</p>
                <p>- Extremely friendly cheese for people. The dongle face and attractive cheese suit are reminiscent of a cat in the boots.</p>
                <p>6. Gray (Persian) / 7 years old / 2.2 kg / girl / Herpetiis virus, coughing and sneezing is severe</p>
                <p>- Gray is the oldest at 7 years old. The coughing and sneezing were so severe that pneumonia was suspected.</p>
                <p>7. Mug (Persian) / 3 years old / 2.5 kg / girl / pneumonia, anorexia, ear mite infection</p>
                <p>- Mug became a mug after the lead of Merryman Gray to make it easier for hospital staff to identify each individual.</p>
                <p>8. White (Persian) / 3 years old / 2.8 kg / Boy / Herpetis virus, fungal dermatitis, ear mite infection</p>
                <p>- White is a first-class credit for stretching his hands by turning the hospital glass all over the place with a runny nose and sneezing.</p>
                <p>Here are 8 cats,</p>
                <p>The photos you see above are photos of the first day that ownership was handed over to Life and headed to the hospital.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned at the outset, most of the rescued cats were suffering from extreme low weight and malnutrition,<br>Despite this state of health, they continue to breed, become pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed.</p>
                <p>Can animals born to these parents grow up healthy? to get rid of the illegal living industry,<br>It's not about buying.</p>
                <p>We will continue to provide you with cat news gaps.</p>
                <p>Animal Protection Organisation Life is a non-profit organization that is not supported by the government or local government.</p>
                <p>The full amount of the operating expenses will be operated by the members' valuable dues.<br>For those of you who want to be a part of Life<br>A treatment fee passbook called "Busan Cat Factory" has been opened.</p>
                <p>*It is not possible to open a passbook in the name of the group as desired passbook.<br>We would like to inform you in advance that we have opened a passbook in your personal name.<br>If you would like to sponsor the cost of treatment, please transfer it to the passbook below. (Deadline)</p>
                <p>*Please note that Life is not yet a donation receipt issuing organization, so the amount you donate will not be able to issue a donation receipt.</p>
                <p>We will notify you of your future sponsorship details separately.</p>
                <p>Life will actively strive for the speedy recovery of rescued animals.</p>
                <p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
