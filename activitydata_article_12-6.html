                <p>September 18,<br>On the roof of a house in Moradong, Busan City Ideological District<br>A man in his 60s is in front of the cubs<br>Ruthlessly Hammering the Mother Dog<br>There was a beating and killing incident.</p>
                <p>The incident was reported by a resident.<br>When the police were dispatched, they were tied to the roof of the house.<br>There was a large amount of bleeding on the head of the mother dog,<br>Next to it is a blunt force that appears to have been used in abuse.<br>The 'hammer' was with them.</p>
                <p>The police then asked the dog owner for an inspector.<br>"You beat me to death, so take care of it."<br>He replied, police said.</p>

                <p>He was bleeding and breathing.<br>In order to save the mother dog, the police<br>First of all, I contacted the relevant municipality.</p>
                <p>However, the local animal protection officer<br>An urgent animal cruelty case has occurred.<br>Facing a complaint without immediate action<br>Only the shelter contact information was handed over to the police,</p>
                <p>The police who called the shelter<br>"Puppies with owners are tough.<br>We only treat organic dogs."<br>I heard the answer.</p>
                <p>The police do not give up<br>Keep looking for a place to get help<br>I contacted the animal protection organization Life.<br>As soon as Life was contacted by the police,<br>Rescue efforts in other areas<br>I finished it in a hurry and rushed to the scene,<br>Unfortunately<br>The mother dog had already died.</p>
                <p>The harrowing scene was<br>It was heartbreaking that it was hard to put it into words.</p>
                <p>Next to the carcass of the mother dog<br>Blood stains were sticking in all directions.<br>A hammer, a tool for killing, was placed in a dungeon.</p>

                <p>Animal cruelty suspects<br>Life's question of why he killed the dog<br>"You can't give a dog anywhere that bites a man,<br>That's why I killed him."</p>
                <p>The most recent bite<br>It was said to be 1 year and a half ago.</p>
                <p>I was ferocious in giving them food.<br>Deciding to kill him.<br>Come with a hammer and head the dog several times<br>He proudly says he was knocked down.</p>
                <p>For those who have dogs,<br>As you all know,<br>The dog you were raising suddenly for no reason<br>There is no biting of a person.</p>
                <p>To the person whose animal takes care of the food<br>What does it mean to be wild?</p>
                <p>To that poor mother dog, the accused<br>He was neither a family member, nor a colleague, nor a friend.</p>
                <p>That relationship has been going on for a whopping 4 years.<br>Trying to rectify that relationship<br>There was no effort whatsoever.</p>
                <p>The feelings between each other, which had gotten so bad,<br>In the end, the harrowing consequences of death<br>Evoked.</p>
                <p>On the disastrous appearance of the mother dog<br>Standing in a daze,<br>In hindsight, the mother dog left behind<br>Two puppies began to be seen.</p>
                <p>Just 3-4 meters from the dead mother,<br>Two puppies aged 2-3 months<br>Looks the biggest in the world<br>The most dependent mother dog in the world<br>The accused was struck by a hammer wielded and screamed,<br>The whole process of struggling with pain and fear<br>I had to see it with my own eyes.</p>
                <p>As a human being, I was so sorry,<br>Anger flared up,<br>What it was like at the time of the urgency<br>It passed through my head like a video.</p>
                <p>The mother dog is abused and<br>Watching the dying process as it is<br>To heal the trauma of the cubs<br>We will make an effort in parallel.</p>
                <p>The image of being frightened and flinching in front of a person<br>As I watch, I cry again.</p>

                <p>After the incident<br>The local government official in charge of the relevant municipality<br>Even in the event of a serious animal cruelty incident<br>It was confirmed that it was a complacent administration.</p>
                <p>If only there had been active action by the municipality.<br>Precious life through hospital treatment<br>It is a great pity that it could have been saved.</p>
                <p>We strongly protest against the municipality in question.<br>To prevent recurrence<br>We will ask for training of animal protection officers, etc.</p>
                <p>Life Goes to Animal Protection<br>The complacency of the local animal protection official<br>It's not like I've seen passive administration once or twice.</p>
                <p>We will continue to think about fundamental measures.</p>
                <p>A society where anyone can raise animals<br>It's a tragic ending.</p>
