                <p>&lt;The coexistence of people and animals seen through the case of the closure of the Gupo Dog Market&gt;</p>
                <p>On the afternoon of July 1, 2019, 5-ton lorries at the entrance to the Kupo Market in North District, Busan City, slowly began to depart somewhere. By the side of the procession of vehicles, many citizens stepped up, waved their hands, and watched the departing vehicles. As I watched the procession of vehicles join the road and move away, I felt a moist layer of dew in the corners of my eyes. Yes, there were dozens of dogs in the vehicle that had been slaughtered in the so-called Goofo Dog Market and nearly been distributed as 'carnivorous' or 'dog owners'. The dogs were rescued by animal rights groups and taken to a shelter in the race.</p>
                <p>As a child in the 1980s, my neighbor's house was a famous bosin-bathing house. When I passed the bosinbath house for school in the morning, I would pass by the white dog carcasses and red blood in the red rubber darai. At the time, there was a dog slaughterhouse next to the bus Dorotga. I usually pass by with my eyes closed, but one day on the way down, I accidentally stopped walking in front of the slaughterhouse, and I still vividly remember the owner of the slaughterhouse taking a small white dog out of the iron cage, laying it on the floor, slashing it with a knife to kill it, and running home as if running home crying and crying when I saw the shimmering blood that had spread on the floor, starting from the neck of that little dog. For now, the owner would have been arrested for violating the Animal Protection Act. At the time, that was routine.</p>
                <p>Today's edible dog farms lock their dogs in narrow iron fields (aka open fields), collect food waste and pour it into a bowl without boiling it. This is a violation of the Feed Control Act. When the temperature rises, the bowl is infested with all kinds of bugs, and when the day gets colder, it freezes as it is. It doesn't cure you for being sick. It doesn't even warm up when it's cold. When it rains, it rains, and when it snows, it just meets snow. It was only 4 years ago that dozens of dogs starved to death after a month of feeding that the cat's garbage food cycle was cumbersome and cumbersome.</p>
                <p>The breeding environment for animals that are raised for edible purposes as well as dogs is cruel. It is the result of industrialization in which the interests of man rather than the welfare of animals have become the primary goal. Chickens do not do a single fly in their lifetime in this space of about three minutes of apo paper, and only lay eggs and die. When they can no longer lay eggs, they pluck out all the hairs. Chickens use their last strength to make them fur according to their instincts. In the process, eggs are produced one or two more times. That's the last time in this run. Pigs eat in a space called a narrow 'stall' without reversing their bodies, and they are cheap, milk-biting and raising piglets. Forcibly separating from the mother to obtain veal meat and feeding it with iron-free artificial milk powder, not breast milk ( If there is iron, the slaughtered meat is less valuable because it gives off a reddish glow) calves often lick their urine due to the lack of iron in their bodies. In order to obtain milk, artificial insemination is forcibly carried out and mothers with the instinct of maternal love are completely isolated from their offspring. Wouldn't the brutal sacrifice of another species of life for the sake of human selfishness be a time for us to look back?</p>
                <p>Profiling the serial murders of Yu Yong-chul and Kang Ho-sun, which made the 2000s tumultuous, revealed that they had committed brutal acts of violence against animals before killing people, and in the 1994 Zizon Wave case, one of the members of the Zizon Party, in an interview with the broadcast, even mocked the murder by comparing it to the fact that he killed a dog shortly after the murder, saying that killing a person was the same as killing a dog.</p>
                <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States said in 2016 that it considers animal cruelty an anti-social crime and will continue to accumulate relevant data. The reason behind the FBI's decision to statistically investigate animal cruelty cases at the federal level is that a survey of offenders incarcerated in the U.S. in violent incidents and the like found that more than half of all respondents had experienced violence against animals in the past. These results show that violence against animals is becoming a social problem that does not only stay with animals, but also shifts to the socially disadvantaged. Violence that is limited to animals should of course not be.</p>
                <p>The "puppy factory" incident, which was revealed on over-the-air TV in 2016, is one of the most stark examples of how our society treats animals. The public's resentment of dog farm owners' attitudes toward animals, such as forcing dogs to make corrections or performing a caesarean section without a veterinary license, led to a campaign to amend the Animal Protection Act, which narrowly exceeded 30 times the online signature rate of citizens on their usual animal-related issues, and created a hasty supply of paper from nearby areas due to the lack of street signings. Not to mention that this incident has moved the political circles that have been reeling from the citizens' consciousness and demand for the strengthening of animal protection laws.</p>
                <p>Around this time, the Busan Citizens' Movement Organizations Regiment (hereinafter referred to as the Citizens' Solidarity) also participated in the animal protection organization as a steering committee. This was a fairly progressive decision that included animals in civic movements, which had been represented by human rights, the environment, the economy, etc., and recognized that the movement for animals was also necessary for the civil society movements of the present era. As a member of the Citizens' Solidarity Steering Committee at the time, I worked with the Citizens' Coalition to campaign against the construction of the Ossyrian Dolphin Showground, which led to the capture of wild dolphins, confined them to a narrow aquarium, and reduced to spectatorship, creating an agenda that the act of making money was unethical and undemocratic, and eventually forcing the company to withdraw its plans to build a dolphin show ground. Of course, the revision of the Wildlife Act has made it difficult to import dolphins) but I think that the handling of animal rights at the level of the civic movement is such that the civic consciousness has matured and we are uncomfortable with the use and sacrifice of animals, and I wonder if the efforts of civic organizations, the decisions of the administrators, the dedication of the civil servants, the will of the merchants, and the harmony of all these things may be the cause of the closure of the Gupo Dog Market, which has been a staple of ironclad castles for decades.</p>
                <p>Of course, it would still be difficult to dare to affirm that it is a world in which people and animals coexist. With this short page, it is difficult to list every single example of animals being sacrificed and exploited by man throughout the world. However, one thing is clear: the world has changed a little bit more since the closure of the Goofo Dog Market, and there is hope that we will be able to reduce animal sacrifices a little more. With that hope, I will be on the train to Daegu tomorrow. 40 years ago, the boy, who could do nothing but cry, takes a picture of the Busan gupo and leaves himself to the citizens to close the Daegu Seven Star Dog Market.</p>
