                <p>When the hospital life of the 8 dogs rescued from the Busan Water Permanent Cat Factory was almost a month old,</p>
                <p>S4 of them had been discharged and admitted to the Life office.</p>
                <p>The renovation of an office space for cats who would be admitted after discharge lasted for several days.</p>
                <p>The other 4 had to be treated further in the hospital and were subsequently discharged and admitted to the Life office.</p>
                <p>How did the appearance of cats after a month of treatment change?</p>
                <p>Xia found very pretty eyes,<br>White looked like a completely different cat.</p>
                <p>Cats that should have been treated and cared for in this way had been used and sacrificed, reduced to a tool of profit.</p>
                <p>Life will take the lead. We will create a society that respects the life of animals.</p>
                <p>With the exception of these 8, the rest of the cats are still used as tools for the production industry.</p>
                <p>The municipality has put a shield of "corrective orders" in front of it, and cats, which were illegal tools, are legitimate tools</p>
                <p>You just have to neglect what is being washed.</p>
                <p>We will talk about the passive administration of Busan City and the Swimming District Office again at a later date.</p>
                <p>Life tells us that we will not give up and will work to the end to rescue the rest of the cats.</p>
                <p>Let me introduce you to the changed appearance of cats.</p>
                <p>1. Xia before 490g, after 990g</p>
                <p>2. Ferry before 310g, after 790g</p>
                <p>Dongle before 1.6kg, after 1.91kg</p>
                <p>4. Curl before 2.3kg, after 2.51kg</p>
                <p>5. Cheese before 2.9kg, after 3.27kg</p>
                <p>6. Gray before 2.2kg, after 2.65kg</p>
                <p>7. mugbefore 2.5kg, after 2.78k</p>
                <p>8. White before 2.8kg, after 3.19kg</p>
                <p>My appearance and facial expression changed so much that I felt as if I was looking at other cats.</p>
                <p>This wasn't the time to fully regain health yet, but it did change a lot compared to when it was rescued.</p>
                <p>Isn't it time to change this society that carelessly treats and uses animals to make a profit?</p>
                <p>The Government, the National Assembly, and the municipalities should do what they can, such as overhauling the relevant laws and changing the standards of administrative processing.</p>
                <p>Strengthening licensing standards for the animal production industry,<br>Strengthening the punishment of unlicensed production,<br>Introduction of animal production industry history system, etc.</p>
                <p>The government and the National Assembly will have to come up with measures to prevent life from being used merely as a tool of profit.</p>
                <p>Animal Protection Group Life is a government or local government<br>It's a nonprofit that doesn't receive support.</p>
                <p>The full amount of the operating expenses will be operated by the members' valuable dues.</p>
                <p>For those of you who want to be a part of Life<br>A treatment fee passbook called "Busan Cat Factory" has been opened.</p>
                <p>*It is not possible to open a passbook in the name of the group as desired passbook.</p>
                <p>We would like to inform you in advance that we have opened a passbook in your personal name.</p>
                <p>If you would like to sponsor the cost of treatment, please transfer to the passbook below ( Deadline)</p>
                <p>*Life is not yet a donation receipt issuer.</p>
                <p>Please note that the amount you donate will not be issued a donation receipt.</p>
                <p>We will notify you of your future sponsorship details separately.</p>

                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
